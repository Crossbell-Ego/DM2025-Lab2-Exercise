Note: I have known David Cronenberg since I was a child (see Siegler 2012 for more detail). This 
review incorporates a conversation I had with Cronenberg on December 17, 2024, at a coffee shop 
near his home in Toronto. 

This is the story of a filmmaker from Toronto, who is well off but not extravagantly wealthy. He 
drives a Tesla and lives in a comfortable but austere home. He is trim and aging well, with a shock 
of white hair and a dry sense of humor. He is an <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">outspoken atheist</span> whose loving stable relationship 
to his Jewish wife is upended when she gets sick with cancer. Their lives become regulated by 
medical forces beyond their control. His wife dies and he buries her. He feels like climbing in the 
grave with her, but he settles for buying a plot next to hers. Eventually, he starts dating again. Out 
of his intense grief and bereavement come a new masterful creative project. 
This above paragraph is a summary of the backstory of The Shrouds in which a man named 
Karsh Relilkh, played by Vincent Cassel, creates GraveTech, a burial shroud equipped with 
cameras which allows someone to see their loved one decompose. It also describes David 
Cronenberg, whose creative project is his new movie The Shrouds, which he wrote and directed. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is Cronenberg’s twenty-third feature film and his most autobiographical since 1979’s The 
Brood.</span> Both films are a response to the dissolution of Cronenberg’s marriages: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the earlier film 
dramatizing a contentious divorce and custody battle with his first wife, and the new film about 
the aftermath of the illness and death of his second wife, to whom he had been married for thirty-
seven years.</span> 
Whereas The Brood is a classic of body horror (a genre of which Cronenberg has been 
rightfully credited as the founder), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Shrouds, if all you knew about it was that it is a noted 
horror auteur’s deeply personal film about illness, loss, and the death of a loved one, you might 
think it would be a ghost story, or a tale of the undead.</span> (Ghosts, hauntings, zombies, and vampires

&quot;&quot;&quot;
have, of course, been used since the birth of cinema, and for thousands of years prior, to work out 
our feelings about death, illness, and loss.) But you would be wrong. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cronenberg, the staunch 
atheist, has, in his fifty-plus year career, never made a film with a supernatural element.</span> And he is 
not about to start now. (Not that he hasn’t been asked: see Siegler 2012, 1101-1102). <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">If one must 
pin down the genre, one might call The Shrouds “an international technothriller art film.”</span> (For 
other examples, see Olivier Assayas’ Demonlover (2002) and Boarding Gate (2007)). 
We learn the backstory in the first sequence of the movie—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an awkward blind date.</span> The 
plot kicks into gear when the GraveTech technology reveals to Karsh that his wife Becca’s corpse 
is growing metallic protuberances and when Karsh’s hi-tech graveyard is vandalized. Who is 
responsible for these violations? Icelandic eco-terrorists who use Runic symbols? A nefarious data-
stealing Chinese textile corporation called Shining Cloth (fast fashion meets ByteDance meets the 
Shining Path)? Citadel Technologies, a Hungarian-Canadian conglomerate, fronted by a seductive 
French-Korean woman? 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">We are in familiar Cronenbergian territory.</span> As I wrote in 2012, “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">secretive, isolated 
communities with authoritative, charismatic leaders and dangerous ideologies are constant features 
in most of his original scripts</span> […] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the plots advance because of warring “cults”</span> (Siegler 2012, 
1108).   
In The Shrouds, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">these groups, who may be either competing or collaborating, seem to be 
part of a shadowy multinational conspiracy.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">These global concerns are the clearest expression of 
Cronenberg’s cosmopolitanism</span> (even more than his 2012 film, titled Cosmopolis) but, unlike say, 
Videodrome’s Spectacular Optical or The Brood’s Somafree Institute, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">they are spoken of but rarely 
seen.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Clearly, Cronenberg, in his late career phase, feels comfortable with a sketched-in plot.</span>1 In 
one of the film’s several subtle touches of black humor, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the real villain is (probably) revealed to</span>

be Becca’s oncologist, the mostly offscreen Dr. Jerry Eckler, who teaches classes on “the 
psychology of healing.” 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Karsh refers to the question of who violated his wife’s body as a “classic detection puzzle”</span> 
but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the audience probably doesn’t care as much about the detective story as it does about the 
resonant images and deep emotions</span>, which I <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">felt most clearly in scenes with Diane Kruger as Becca 
appearing nude and evermore disfigured in Karsh’s dreams.</span> (She is emphatically not a ghost.) 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Becca’s absence/presence is also felt in scenes with Kruger as Becca’s twin Terry, and as the voice 
of the untrustworthy AI animated avatar, Hunny.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cronenberg, of course, is interested in the 
physical effect of emotions</span> as exemplified in the opening line of movie, spoken by Karsh’s dentist: 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Grief is rotting your teeth.”</span> Relatedly, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one source of the powerful emotion coursing through The 
Shrouds comes from Cronenberg’s self-recognition of his own mortality</span> (a “relikh?!”). (As other 
film critics have pointed out, several other films made in 2024 share this theme.2) 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The plot, the imagery, and the emotional themes of this film center on graves and bodies 
being desecrated—and “desecration” is a word that is notably used in this movie.</span> “To desecrate” 
means to violate something sacred, and knowing this fact,  along with the film’s autobiographical 
nature, it should come as no surprise that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Shrouds stands as Cronenberg’s most Jewish film</span>. 
True, Cronenberg does not deign to make his stand-in, Karsh, come from a secular Jewish 
background, as Cronenberg himself does. Instead, Karsh tells his blind date, he is “some 
Belarusian Eastern Orthodox thing.” But elsewhere, Jewishness abounds—in the allusions to 
Jewish food (a way many secular Jews relate to their tradition), including Guy Pearce as tech nerd 
Maury chowing down on Matzoh ball soup and pastrami, and references to United Dairy and Fat 
Pasha, two actual Jewish-identified restaurants in Toronto. (Many of Cronenberg’s films are 
explicitly set in Toronto, but The Shrouds is the first to be set in Jewish Toronto.) As well,  Karsh

&quot;&quot;&quot;
deflects Terry’s conspiracy theorizing by referencing Stalin’s paranoid antisemitic dictum, 
“(Jewish) doctors plot.” And most resonantly, we see Jewishness in the Hebrew letters carved on 
Becca’s gravestone.  
But this is not a case of an aging artist “finding God” or “returning to his roots.” If The 
Shrouds is Cronenberg’s most Jewish film <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it is also his most atheist</span>. Cronenberg, in his public 
statements, has always been among the most avowedly atheist filmmakers, but his characters were 
not. Until now. In the first sequence of the movie, Karsh refers to himself a “non-observant atheist” 
and calls the shroud of Turin a fake. Later, speculating his private graveyard might have been 
vandalized by religious extremists, he notes that “we’ve been called techno-atheist infidels.” 
In some ways, The Shrouds embodies a very old debate between tradition and modernity 
or religion and atheism, enacted at multiple levels, not least in a seemingly throwaway bit of 
dialogue about the “burial versus cremation” debate: burial being necessary in the Jewish tradition, 
while cremation being seen as more ecological and modern. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cronenberg, wisely, does not presume 
to settle this debate, but simply records how it plays out on an emotional level</span>—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">through a powerful 
depiction of grief, yes, but also of confusion and anger</span> (at a medical establishment that robs us of 
our power, among other indignities).  And finally, as shown in the last scene of Karsh flying across 
the ocean towards an uncertain future, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there is a glimmer of hopefulness towards whatever comes 
next</span>. 


1 Or Dangling subplots and antagonists referred to but never seen, which point to the fact that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Shrouds was written 
to be the pilot for a Netflix series</span>. (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The series itself would have shown more of these groups, and, Cronenberg told 
me, more about death rituals of various religions</span>.)  

2 I owe this insight to John Semley writing in The Baffler. Similarly, Marya Gates on the Filmspotting Podcast 
thoughtfully places The Shrouds with two other 2024 films about losing a longtime spouse, made by aging directors 
who were also in the process of losing spouses: Oh Canada from Paul Schrader and Megalopolis from Francis Ford 
Coppola.
