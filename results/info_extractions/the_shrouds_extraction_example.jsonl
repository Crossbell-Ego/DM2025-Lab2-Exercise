This \nreview incorporates a conversation I had with Cronenberg on December 17, 2024, at a coffee shop \nnear his home in Toronto. \n \nThis is the story of a filmmaker from Toronto, who is well off but not extravagantly wealthy. He \ndrives a Tesla and lives in a comfortable but austere home. He is trim and aging well, with a shock \nof white hair and a dry sense of humor. He is an outspoken atheist whose loving stable relationship \nto his Jewish wife is upended when she gets sick with cancer. Their lives become regulated by \nmedical forces beyond their control. His wife dies and he buries her. He feels like climbing in the \ngrave with her, but he settles for buying a plot next to hers. Eventually, he starts dating again. Out \nof his intense grief and bereavement come a new masterful creative project. \nThis above paragraph is a summary of the backstory of The Shrouds in which a man named \nKarsh Relilkh, played by Vincent Cassel, creates GraveTech, a burial shroud equipped with \ncameras which allows someone to see their loved one decompose. It also describes David \nCronenberg, whose creative project is his new movie The Shrouds, which he wrote and directed. \nThis is Cronenberg’s twenty-third feature film and his most autobiographical since 1979’s The \nBrood. Both films are a response to the dissolution of Cronenberg’s marriages: the earlier film \ndramatizing a contentious divorce and custody battle with his first wife, and the new film about \nthe aftermath of the illness and death of his second wife, to whom he had been married for thirty-\nseven years. \nWhereas The Brood is a classic of body horror (a genre of which Cronenberg has been \nrightfully credited as the founder), The Shrouds, if all you knew about it was that it is a noted \nhorror auteur’s deeply personal film about illness, loss, and the death of a loved one, you might \nthink it would be a ghost story, or a tale of the undead. (Ghosts, hauntings, zombies, and vampires \n1\nSiegler: The Shrouds\nPublished by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2025\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 4**\n\"\"\"\nhave, of course, been used since the birth of cinema, and for thousands of years prior, to work out \nour feelings about death, illness, and loss.) But you would be wrong. Cronenberg, the staunch \natheist, has, in his fifty-plus year career, never made a film with a supernatural element. And he is \nnot about to start now. (Not that he hasn’t been asked: see Siegler 2012, 1101-1102). If one must \npin down the genre, one might call The Shrouds “an international technothriller art film.” (For \nother examples, see Olivier Assayas’ Demonlover (2002) and Boarding Gate (2007)). \nWe learn the backstory in the first sequence of the movie—an awkward blind date. The \nplot kicks into gear when the GraveTech technology reveals to Karsh that his wife Becca’s corpse \nis growing metallic protuberances and when Karsh’s hi-tech graveyard is vandalized. Who is \nresponsible for these violations? Icelandic eco-terrorists who use Runic symbols? A nefarious data-\nstealing Chinese textile corporation called Shining Cloth (fast fashion meets ByteDance meets the \nShining Path)? Citadel Technologies, a Hungarian-Canadian conglomerate, fronted by a seductive \nFrench-Korean woman? \n \nWe are in familiar Cronenbergian territory. As I wrote in 2012, “secretive, isolated \ncommunities with authoritative, charismatic leaders and dangerous ideologies are constant features \nin most of his original scripts […] the plots advance because of warring “cults” (Siegler 2012, \n1108).   \nIn The Shrouds, these groups, who may be either competing or collaborating, seem to be \npart of a shadowy multinational conspiracy. These global concerns are the clearest expression of \nCronenberg’s cosmopolitanism (even more than his 2012 film, titled Cosmopolis) but, unlike say, \nVideodrome’s Spectacular Optical or The Brood’s Somafree Institute, they are spoken of but rarely \nseen. Clearly, Cronenberg, in his late career phase, feels comfortable with a sketched-in plot.1 In \none of the film’s several subtle touches of black humor, the real villain is (probably) revealed to \n2\nJournal of Religion & Film, Vol. 29 [2025], Iss. 1, Art. 77\nhttps://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol29/iss1/77\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.32873/uno.dc.jrf.29.01.77\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 5**\n\"\"\"\nbe Becca’s oncologist, the mostly offscreen Dr. Jerry Eckler, who teaches classes on “the \npsychology of healing.” \n \nKarsh refers to the question of who violated his wife’s body as a “classic detection puzzle” \nbut the audience probably doesn’t care as much about the detective story as it does about the \nresonant images and deep emotions, which I felt most clearly in scenes with Diane Kruger as Becca \nappearing nude and evermore disfigured in Karsh’s dreams. (She is emphatically not a ghost.) \nBecca’s absence/presence is also felt in scenes with Kruger as Becca’s twin Terry, and as the voice \nof the untrustworthy AI animated avatar, Hunny. Cronenberg, of course, is interested in the \nphysical effect of emotions as exemplified in the opening line of movie, spoken by Karsh’s dentist: \n“Grief is rotting your teeth.” Relatedly, one source of the powerful emotion coursing through The \nShrouds comes from Cronenberg’s self-recognition of his own mortality (a “relikh?!”). (As other \nfilm critics have pointed out, several other films made in 2024 share this theme.2) \nThe plot, the imagery, and the emotional themes of this film center on graves and bodies \nbeing desecrated—and “desecration” is a word that is notably used in this movie. “To desecrate” \nmeans to violate something sacred, and knowing this fact,  along with the film’s autobiographical \nnature, it should come as no surprise that The Shrouds stands as Cronenberg’s most Jewish film. \nTrue, Cronenberg does not deign to make his stand-in, Karsh, come from a secular Jewish \nbackground, as Cronenberg himself does. Instead, Karsh tells his blind date, he is “some \nBelarusian Eastern Orthodox thing.” But elsewhere, Jewishness abounds—in the allusions to \nJewish food (a way many secular Jews relate to their tradition), including Guy Pearce as tech nerd \nMaury chowing down on Matzoh ball soup and pastrami, and references to United Dairy and Fat \nPasha, two actual Jewish-identified restaurants in Toronto. (Many of Cronenberg’s films are \nexplicitly set in Toronto, but The Shrouds is the first to be set in Jewish Toronto.) As well,  Karsh \n3\nSiegler: The Shrouds\nPublished by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2025\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 6**\n\"\"\"\ndeflects Terry’s conspiracy theorizing by referencing Stalin’s paranoid antisemitic dictum, \n“(Jewish) doctors plot.” And most resonantly, we see Jewishness in the Hebrew letters carved on \nBecca’s gravestone.  \nBut this is not a case of an aging artist “finding God” or “returning to his roots.” If The \nShrouds is Cronenberg’s most Jewish film it is also his most atheist. Cronenberg, in his public \nstatements, has always been among the most avowedly atheist filmmakers, but his characters were \nnot. Until now. In the first sequence of the movie, Karsh refers to himself a “non-observant atheist” \nand calls the shroud of Turin a fake. Later, speculating his private graveyard might have been \nvandalized by religious extremists, he notes that “we’ve been called techno-atheist infidels.” \nIn some ways, The Shrouds embodies a very old debate between tradition and modernity \nor religion and atheism, enacted at multiple levels, not least in a seemingly throwaway bit of \ndialogue about the “burial versus cremation” debate: burial being necessary in the Jewish tradition, \nwhile cremation being seen as more ecological and modern. Cronenberg, wisely, does not presume \nto settle this debate, but simply records how it plays out on an emotional level—through a powerful \ndepiction of grief, yes, but also of confusion and anger (at a medical establishment that robs us of \nour power, among other indignities).  And finally, as shown in the last scene of Karsh flying across \nthe ocean towards an uncertain future, there is a glimmer of hopefulness towards whatever comes \nnext. \n \n \n1 Or Dangling subplots and antagonists referred to but never seen, which point to the fact that The Shrouds was written \nto be the pilot for a Netflix series. (The series itself would have shown more of these groups, and, Cronenberg told \nme, more about death rituals of various religions.)  \n \n2 I owe this insight to John Semley writing in The Baffler. Similarly, Marya Gates on the Filmspotting Podcast \nthoughtfully places The Shrouds with two other 2024 films about losing a longtime spouse, made by aging directors \nwho were also in the process of losing spouses: Oh Canada from Paul Schrader and Megalopolis from Francis Ford \nCoppola. \n \n4\nJournal of Religion & Film, Vol. 29 [2025], Iss. 1, Art. 77\nhttps://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol29/iss1/77\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.32873/uno.dc.jrf.29.01.77\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 7**\n\"\"\"\nReferences \n  \n \nGates, Marya.
